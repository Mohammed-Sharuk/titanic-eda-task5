# Titanic Survival Prediction - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** for the Titanic dataset as part of **Task 5** of my internship.  
The goal was to understand the survival patterns of passengers based on various features like gender, class, age, and more.

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

- Data Cleaning and Null Value Handling
- Data Visualization using Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Feature-wise Survival Analysis:
  - Gender-wise
  - Class-wise (Pclass)
  - Age Distribution
  - Embarkation Port
- Correlation Matrix and Heatmap

## 📦 Libraries Used

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## 🔍 Dataset

Used the classic **Titanic dataset** from Kaggle/Seaborn, which contains information on passengers like:
- Age
- Sex
- Pclass (Ticket class)
- Fare
- Embarked (Port of embarkation)
- Survived (Target variable)

---

## 📌 Conclusion

The analysis reveals that:
- **Females** had a significantly higher survival rate.
- Passengers in **higher classes (1st class)** had better chances of survival.
- **Children** also had a higher survival rate compared to adults.
